    <h1>What I Learned and Enjoyed in Programming</h1>
    <p>
        During my journey in learning programming, I greatly enjoyed exploring fundamental concepts such as **Data Structures** and algorithms. Understanding how to organize data and the efficiency of problem-solving was incredibly fascinating. I also enjoyed applying **Python** to write simple code and create small programs, especially in the field of data analysis, where I found its flexibility and readability very appealing. Learning to build basic user interfaces using **HTML and CSS** was also enjoyable, as it allowed me to see the visual results of my work instantly.
    </p>

    <h1>Topics I Want to Learn More About</h1>
    <p>
        I am very much looking forward to deepening my understanding in **Full-stack Web Development**. I want to learn frameworks like **React.js** for front-end and **Node.js with Express** for back-end, to build interactive and robust web applications. I am also very interested in the field of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, specifically Machine Learning, and would like to study how to build and train models to solve real-world problems. I also hope to explore **Databases** more deeply, such as SQL and NoSQL, and how to interact with them efficiently.
    </p>

    <h1>Challenges I Faced in My Learning Journey</h1>
    <p>
        In the beginning of my learning, I faced some difficulties understanding the concept of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. It took me time to grasp the differences between Classes and Objects, and the principles of inheritance and abstraction. Also, **Debugging** was a major challenge initially, especially when dealing with long and complex code; I used to spend hours searching for a simple error. Similarly, understanding how **Asynchronous Requests** work on the web was confusing at first, but with practice, things gradually became clearer.
